<h1>CSEWiki Structure (for custom wiki-engine)</h1>

<hr>

<p>The CSEWiki shall be composed as a collection of topics, each topic being unique
and made of any number of subtopics. Each topic shall be defined in a text-file
known as a <strong>topic-file</strong>. Along with each topic file shall be another
(optional) text file called a <strong>tag-file</strong> which defines the tags (or related
topics) related to the given topic. </p>

<p>The CSEWiki shall be published as a website with one web-page per topic. Each
web-page shall be generated from a correlating <strong>topic-file</strong> and will be styled
by a css file called "style.css". </p>

<h3>Directories</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> all directories and files shall be lowercased. Each directory shall be
named with one word made of any number of alpha-numeric characters (if two or
more words must be used then the hyphen "-" shall be used instead of spaces).</p>

<p>All files related to the CSEWiki shall reside under a single parent directory
called <strong>csewiki</strong>. All web-page related files shall reside under the <strong>html</strong>
directory. All topic-files shall reside under the <strong>topic</strong> directory. Under 
<strong>topic</strong> can reside other sub-directories for organizing topic-files. The name
of the general-topic directories shall be named for the general topic that
summarizes all the topics contained within. For example a general topic
directory named "languages" will contain topic-files "c.txt", "java.txt",
"cplusplus.txt" and "c-sharp.txt" topic-files and their respective tag files.</p>

<h3>Topic Files</h3>

<p>Each topic file will contain the information for a single topic. </p>
