#CSEWiki Structure (for custom wiki-engine)
- - - 

The CSEWiki shall be composed as a collection of topics, each topic being unique
and made of any number of subtopics. Each topic shall be defined in a text-file
known as a __topic-file__. Along with each topic file shall be another
(optional) text file called a __tag-file__ which defines the tags (or related
topics) related to the given topic. 

The CSEWiki shall be published as a website with one web-page per topic. Each
web-page shall be generated from a correlating __topic-file__ and will be styled
by a css file called "style.css".

### Directories 

**NOTE:** all directories and files shall be lowercased. Each directory shall be
named with one word made of any number of alpha-numeric characters (if two or
more words must be used then the hyphen "-" shall be used instead of spaces).

All files related to the CSEWiki shall reside under a single parent directory
called __csewiki__. All web-page related files shall reside under the __html__
directory. All topic-files shall reside under the __topic__ directory. Under 
__topic__ can reside other sub-directories for organizing topic-files. The name
of the general-topic directories shall be named for the general topic that
summarizes all the topics contained within. For example a general topic
directory named "languages" will contain topic-files "c.txt", "java.txt",
"cplusplus.txt" and "c-sharp.txt" topic-files and their respective tag files.

### Topic Files 

Each topic file will contain the information for a single topic.
